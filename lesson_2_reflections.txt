What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- A .git directory is created.  This lets git know that you are tracking it.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- Staging area is for files you're ready to commit.  The working directory is just all the files in the directory so staging lets you explictly name files to commit.  The repository contains the history.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
- You can keep on adding changes to staging until the next change is clearly of something different.
